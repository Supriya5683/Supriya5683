I’m interested in DevOps Engineering, automation, and cloud technologies.
I’m currently learning DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, and AWS .
I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps projects, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployments.
I love solving real-world problems using automation scripts and enjoy exploring new tech with a cup of chai! ☕
